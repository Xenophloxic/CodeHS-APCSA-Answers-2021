### Question: 1
##### How many times does the following loop execute?
```java
// x has been initialized with a positive int value greater than 5
int count = 5;
while (count < x) 
{
    count++;
}
```

##### Answer: `x - 5 times`

### Question: 2
##### Consider the following code snippet. Is count < 5 always true, always false, or sometimes true/sometimes false at point 3?
```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) 
{
     System.out.println("CodeHS Rocks!");
     count++;
}
// point 3
```

##### Answer: `count < 5 always false at point 3`

### Question: 3
##### How many times does the following loop iterate?
```java
// x has been initialized with a positive int value
int count = 0;
while (count < x) 
{
  count++;
}
```

##### Answer: `x times`

### Question: 4
###### Consider the following code snippet. Is count < 5 always true, always false, or sometimes true/sometimes false at point 2?
```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) 
{
     System.out.println("CodeHS Rocks!");
     count++;
     // point 2
}
```

##### Answer: `count < 5 is sometimes true/sometimes false at point 2`

### Question: 5
##### How many times does the following loop iterate?
```java
// x has been initialized with a positive int value
for (int count = 0; count <= x; count++) 
{
    System.out.print("*");
}
```

##### Answer: `x + 1 times`

### Question: 6
##### Why is having efficient algorithms important?

##### Answer: `Both 1 and 2.`

### Question: 7
##### Consider the following code snippet. Is count < 5 always true, always false, or sometimes true/sometimes false at point 1?
```java
int count = 0;
while (count < 5) 
{
     // point 1
     System.out.println("CodeHS Rocks!");
     count++;
}
```

##### Answer: `count < 5 is always true at point 1`
