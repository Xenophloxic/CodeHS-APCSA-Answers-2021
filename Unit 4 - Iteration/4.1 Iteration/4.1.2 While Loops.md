### Question: 2

### Question: 3
##### Which statement could be added to the while loop below so that it doesn’t run indefinitely?
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
       int x = 7;
       while (x > 0)
       {
          System.out.println(x);
       }
}
```

##### Answer: `Both A and B above.`

### Question: 4
##### Why does the following code produce an infinite loop? Choose the best answer.
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
       int x = 7;
       while (x > 0)
       {
          System.out.println(x);
       }
}
```

##### Answer: `The loop doesn’t ever change the value of x in the loop, so it never ends.`

### Question: 5
##### What does the following code print?
```java
int x = -4;
while (x < 0)
{
   x++;
   System.out.print(x + " ");

        int x = 1;
        while (x > 10)
        {
            System.out.println(x);
             x--;
        }
}
