# CodeHS-APCSA-Answers-2021
My answers to CodeHS's APCSA Java Course. This is intended to help, not to give answers.

### If there are any issues, new problems, or anything else that needs my attention to fix, please create an issue and I will check it out.

I am a 9th grader with tons of previous programming knowledge taking APCSA in the 2021-2022 school year. After seeing many of my fellow classmates struggle with coming up with answers and not really undertanding what is going on, I decided to create this. In my experience, my classmates are able to explain what is happening and can solve similar problem sets with ease after seeing the answers. I hope I am clear enough on what is happening in my files, but if I am not, please create an issue and I will try to fix it ASAP!

### I hope this repo helps you along in your class and maybe even into your career!
