The first if statement sees if str 1 is "null," then it will have the same string as string 2. The second if statement sees if strings 1 and 2 are equal then print "str1 and str2 refer to the same object." The third if statement compares strings 2 and 3 and sees if they refer to the same object. The fourth if statement sees if string 1 is equal to 2, and string 2 is equal to 3, then print "str1, str2, and str3 are equal." The fifth if statement compares strings 1 and 2 and strings 2 and 3 and then prints "str1, str2, and str3 are the same objects."

2) I turned the 3rd and fifth if statements into comments because they were not necessary since the fourth if statements eliminate their need for being since it already checks if they are equal thus eliminating the fifth and second if statement.
