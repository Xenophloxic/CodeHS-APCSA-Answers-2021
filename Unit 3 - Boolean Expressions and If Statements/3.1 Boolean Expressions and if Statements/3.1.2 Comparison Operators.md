### Question: 4

##### Consider the code snippet below.
```java
String name = "Karel";
String checkName = new String("Karel");

boolean nameMatches = name == checkName;
Note that we forced Java to create a new String object by using new and calling the String constructor.
Recall that if you set two String variables to the same String literal, Java tries to be efficient and uses the same object.
